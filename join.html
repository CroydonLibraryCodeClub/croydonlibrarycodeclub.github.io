                <h3>Suitability</h3>
                <p>Our Code Club is targeted at children between the ages of 9 and 13. If your children are younger or older, they are welcome to join, but our project materials might not be as engaging to younger or older children.</p>
                <h3>Weekly newsletters</h3>
                <p>Once you have joined our club, you will receive a weekly newsletter every Saturday morning. This newsletter will contain the weekly challenge and showcase club member projects from the previous week. <a href="newsletters.html">Click here to see our earlier newsletters.</a></p>
                <h3>Scratch and Trinket</h3>
                <p>To join in the coding challenges, each child will need an <a href="scratch.html">account for programming in Scratch</a> and / or a <a href="trinket.html">Trinket account</a> for programming in HTML or Python.</p>
                <h3>Live sessions</h3>
                <p>We normally run our club on Saturdays from 9.30am to 10.30am at Croydon Central library in the children ºs library section. Due to the COVID-19 lockdown we are instead running a Discord server at our regular time each Saturday. Your weekly newsletter will contain an invitation link to join our server. These links are time limited to 1 hour after we send them out.</p>
                <h3>Discord</h3>
                <p>If you would like your children to have access to our live chat you will need to set up a <a href="discord.html">Discord account</a> for them.</p>
