                <p>Scratch On!</p>

                        href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/pizzafordessert/">@pizzafordessert</a> for creating this
                    prompt.</p>
                <h3>Chain Reaction</h3>
                <p>A chain reaction is when one event causes a chain of events to occur afterwards. For example, a ball could roll onto the screen, bumping into another ball, causing it to roll away. Where does the ball go? Does it bump into something else? What happens next is up to you!</p>
