Good morning code club
We will be back in Croydon Library from today. Our new time is from 10:00 am to 11:00 am. Send me an email for more information. But we will continue our weekly challenges for those who cannot make it in.

Our new project
Our theme this week is fireworks. Here are some project resources you can use. You can either remix this project by pressing the remix button, or see inside and drag the sprite into your backpack.
