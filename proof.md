Good morning code club,

If you've recently signed up, make sure you download Discord for your computer so you can join in our live server on Saturday mornings.

Once you have Discord installed, you can join us live on Saturday morning by clicking on the link that you'll find at the bottom of tomorrow morning's email.

If you have any problems connecting, please let me know.

See you soon,

Paul.
