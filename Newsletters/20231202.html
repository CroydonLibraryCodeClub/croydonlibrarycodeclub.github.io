				<h2>Good morning code club</h2>
				<h3>2023: A Year in Review</h3>
				<p>2023 is coming to an end and it offers an opportunity to <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/34253687/">look back</a> on the past year of creating projects, participating in studios, and making new Scratch friends! We invite you to create a project to share moments on Scratch from 2023 you would like to remember.</p>
