                <h2>Happy Easter code club</h2>
                <p>We are currently on our Easter break. We will be back in the library next Saturday the 30th of April.</p>
				<p>Until then you can still create projects at home. We have new themes for projects each week. If you get stuck, send an email to the address below.</p>
				<h3>New theme</h3>
                <p>Our theme this week is <em>Lights</em>. Here is some <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/14240868/">inspiration</a> to get you started.</p>
                <div class="center-figure">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../Gallery/Lights/Lights.png" alt="Lights" />
                        <figcaption><em>Lights</em> by midozer</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
				<p>Send an email to my address below to let us know how you got on.</p>
                <h3>Things to try</h3>
				<p>If you are stuck for project ideas, you can remix projects from other Scratchers. For example, Chinazom remixed this project <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/654805528/"></a>:</p>
                <div class="center-figure">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../Gallery/Online/Remix.png" alt="2D Paper Minecraft" />
                        <figcaption><em>2D Paper Minecraft</em> by griffpatch, remixed by Chinazom</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
				<p>If you want to try this yourself, just click the remix button on any project. You can also modify the project and make it your own!</p>
				<h3>Tell your friends</h3>
				<p>If you have friends you think might like to join our club, get them to ask their parents to email us and we will sign them up!</p>
                <h3>Suggest a challenge</h3>
                <p>If you have an idea for a theme, send your suggestion to the email link below.</p>
