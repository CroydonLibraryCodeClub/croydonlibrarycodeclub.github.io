                <h2>Good morning code club</h2>
                <p>We have returned to Croydon Library. Send me an email if you would like to join us 10:00 am to 11:00 am on Saturday mornings.</p>
                <p>This is our last club at the library before the Easter break. We will be back soon, but there will be new themes in the newsletters for those that want to continue programming over the holidays.</p>
				<h3>New project</h3>
                <p>Our theme this week is <em>Easter Eggs</em>. Did you know that most video games contain Easter eggs? Video game programmers often hide secrets in their games - we call these secrets "Easter eggs." Can you hide an Easter egg in your next project?</p>

                <h3>Things to try</h3>
				<p>If you want to try <em>Python</em> to make your code club theme projects, why not give <a href="https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">pgzero</a> a try.</p>
				<p><code>pgzero</code> is a Python library that makes it easier to turn your Scratch projects into Python projects.</p>
				<p>If you have Python installed, you can install <code>pgzero</code> by entering the following command in your Windows Command prompt, or Mac or Linux Terminal:</p>
				<pre>
					<code>
pip install pgzero
					</code>
				</pre>
					<h3>Tell your friends</h3>
				<p>If you have friends you think might like to join our club, get them to ask their parents to email us and we will sign them up!</p>
                <h3>Suggest a challenge</h3>
                <p>If you have an idea for a theme, send your suggestion to the email link below.</p>
                <h3>Submissions</h3>
                <p>Be sure to get your entry in by Thursday and I will include your work in next week ºs newsletter.
