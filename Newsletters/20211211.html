                <h2>Good morning code club</h2>
                <p>We have returned to Croydon Library from 10:00 am to 11:00 am on Saturday mornings. Send me an email if you would like to join us.</p>
				<h3>Our new project</h3>
                <p>Our theme this week is <em>I made you a book</em>. Here is our <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/i-made-you-a-book">I made you a book</a> project:</p>
                <div class="center-figure">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../Gallery/MakeBook/MakeBook.png" alt="I made you a book" />
                        <figcaption>The <em>I made you a book</em> project instructions</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <h3>Something new to try</h3>
				<p>If you want to try <em>Python</em> to make your code club theme projects, why not give <a href="https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">pgzero</a> a try.</p>
				<p><code>pgzero</code> is a Python library that makes it easier to turn your Scratch projects into Python projects.</p>
				<p>If you have Python installed, you can install <code>pgzero</code> by entering the following command in your Windows Command prompt, or Mac or Linux Terminal:</p>
				<pre>
					<code>
pip install pgzero
					</code>
				</pre>
                <p>Did you make a <em>Surprise Animation</em> project last week? What did you make? Send an email to the link below and
                    let us know.</p>
					<h3>Tell your friends</h3>
				<p>If you have friends you think might like to join our club, get them to ask their parents to email us and we will sign them up!</p>
                <h3>Suggest a challenge</h3>
                <p>If you have an idea for a theme, send your suggestion to the email link below.</p>
                <h3>Submissions</h3>
                <p>Be sure to get your entry in by Thursday and I will include your work in next week ºs newsletter.
